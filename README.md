# Keddit
A community-driven social media site, inspired by Reddit with Twilio functionally. Users will be able to create an account, upload their custom profile picture, create communities, post topics, comment, and vote. I plan to utilize the GIPHY API and Twilio’s SMS API. For GIPHY’s API, users will be able to post gifs hosted by GIPHY as a comment. With Twilio’s SMS API, users will be able to send their friends and family their favorite posts via text.
